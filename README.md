## Inspiration: An experience that make you change the way things are.
We all visit many restaurants every once in a while and we all have gone to this one place which has amazing food yet very slow service, though it is said that the more you wait before the more you enjoy afterwards but sometimes it ruins the spirit with which we arrived, and the time we wasted while waiting is an issue in itself. So, we thought of developing a solution to this problem of increased waiting time due to slow service.

## What it does: It helps saving your time
When we arrive at the restaurant and get seated, our table would have a QR when we scan it we can get access to services like, sign-in, menu, calling waiter, viewing and placing order at  your fingertips

## How we built it?
Starting from customer view, we provided a menu of items and the functions from which customer can view and place order and if they face any issue they can call a waiter for help. We connected it from database so that customer can fetch menu and place order straight to the database. Then the restaurant staff can view order list with associated table number and complete preparing order from their side. Staff will also be alerted if any customer calls for waiter. 

## Challenges we ran into:
From designing UI to deploying our web application, we came across many challenges. User-friendly UI needs creativity and time, it was acceptable too but then the errors we faced on every other step, handling different states according to user preferences and building the logic behind all of the working functionalities was a big challenge in itself

## Accomplishments that we're proud of: Project Completion
Despite of all the problems we faced in these 48 hours and considering the hack to be built in limited amount of time and resources, we still managed to finish it in time and now we're ready for presentation.

## What we learned: 
Development is a type of learning itself because every time you're trying to build something, we run into many troubles and after looking them out and trying something else instead, helps us to learn many new things. We explored react states and contexts, firebase deployment, git issues and pull requests and many more useful things along the way.

## What's next for Swift Snack: The only way is up
We are planning to add payment integration, multiple customer and restaurant management, chef's ease (providing best possible combination of order list with respect to dish's preparation time and priority according to FCFS method so that customer doesn't need to wait too long if they have just few things to order), fetching closest waiter to call to receive faster service and other essential features required. Swift Snack is just a few step away in becoming a solution that many restaurants can use as a product, be it a small scale or a large scale one, improvement is always beneficial in businesses. We can customize it according to their needs and we can even implement it in other places facing similar issues.
